_Analyzing ESG Scores with Python Precision_

This project analyzes ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) scores using various data science techniques. The project aims to provide insights into the ESG performance of different companies, leveraging Python libraries and visualization tools.

## **Situation**

- ESG data is critical for assessing the sustainability and societal impact of companies, aiding investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions.
- This project focuses on retrieving and analyzing ESG scores for multiple companies, providing a comprehensive view of their performance in terms of environmental, social, and governance factors.

## **Task**

- Develop a data pipeline that retrieves ESG scores for multiple companies, perform data preprocessing, and create visualizations to highlight key insights.
- Implement a user-friendly Streamlit web application for interactive analysis and visualization of ESG data.

## **Approach**

1. **Data Retrieval:** Utilized the `yesg` library to fetch ESG scores for multiple companies. This involved creating functions to retrieve and process data efficiently.
2. **Data Processing:** Cleaned and preprocessed the ESG data using `pandas`. This included handling missing values, normalizing scores, and preparing data for visualization.
3. **Visualization:** Employed `plotly` for creating interactive visualizations, showcasing trends and comparisons across different ESG dimensions.
4. **Web Application:** Developed a Streamlit application to provide an interactive interface for users to explore ESG data. This included various UI components for selecting companies, filtering data, and viewing detailed insights.
5. **Natural Language Processing:** Leveraged LangChain to process and analyze textual data related to ESG scores, extracting meaningful insights from reports and documents.
6. **Dockerization:** Used Docker to containerize the application, ensuring portability and ease of deployment.

## **Results**

- Successfully built a data pipeline that retrieves and processes ESG scores for multiple companies.
- Created a user-friendly Streamlit application with interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore ESG data effortlessly.
- Enhanced understanding of ESG performance across different companies, providing valuable insights for investors and stakeholders.
- Utilized LangChain for effective natural language processing, adding depth to the analysis.
- The containerized application can be easily deployed, ensuring consistent performance across different environments.

## **Key Libraries and Tools**

- **Python 3.12**: Core programming language.
- **yesg 2.1.1**: Library for fetching ESG scores.
- **pandas 2.2.2**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **plotly 5.20.0**: Interactive visualization.
- **streamlit 1.32.1**: Web application framework.
- **LangChain**: Natural language processing for textual analysis.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment.
